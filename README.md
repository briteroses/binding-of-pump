# binding-of-pump
This is a recreation of video game Binding of Isaac in Java using the Slick2D engine.
WASD to move, arrow keys to shoot
Most core features of the original game are implemented, including procedural level generation.
About ~140 items are implemented, most directly from the original game and some with new original effects.
5 bosses are implemented, some with original designs not in the base game.
There are a few gameplay mechanics not in the original game; mainly, I've added a bullet time feature where
holding down spacebar slows down player, enemy, and bullet movement, allowing for finer dodging and control, and depletes the "LP" energy meter.
There are also blue bullets which only hurt you if you are moving; this is a feature taken from another video game Undertale.
Playing the game will likely also require you to install the Slick2D library on your own machine first;
if that's a hassle, you can check out a gameplay demonstration here:
